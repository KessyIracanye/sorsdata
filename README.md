# Enhanced SORS Analysis – MATLAB Script & Data

This repository contains the MATLAB script and associated data outputs used in the study of multi-offset Spatially Offset Raman Spectroscopy (SORS) for analyte detection and quantification.

## 📁 Contents

- `enhanced_sors_analysis.m`: Main MATLAB script for analyzing SORS datasets.
- `*.csv`: Exported results including peak areas, fit quality metrics, preprocessing comparisons, and composition estimates.
- `README.md`: Overview of the repository and usage instructions.

## 🧪 Features

- SNV and other preprocessing methods
- Gaussian and trapezoidal peak area analysis
- Fit Quality (R²) as the primary metric
- Variance filtering for anisole and MTBE peaks
- Offset performance ranking and composition estimation
- Comprehensive CSV export for reproducibility

## 📊 Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Open `enhanced_sors_analysis.m` in MATLAB.
3. Run the script and select your `.mat` files when prompted.
4. Results will be saved in the `Enhanced_SORS_Analysis` folder.
